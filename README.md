# ANPR Under Occlusion and Poor Visibility

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems face significant challenges under real-world conditions such as occlusion (partial blockage of plates) and poor visibility (e.g., fog, low light, motion blur). This project aims to build a **robust ANPR pipeline** capable of detecting and recognizing number plates even under such adverse scenarios using deep learning and image enhancement techniques.

## üîç Problem Statement

Standard ANPR systems often fail when the license plate is:
- **Partially occluded** (by objects, dirt, or other vehicles)
- **Captured in low visibility** (nighttime, rain, fog, glare)

This project aims to **improve detection and recognition accuracy** in these conditions.
